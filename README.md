# Binary0101
 
Binary 0101 is an app I created using Elm in first year taking "Introduction to Software Design Using Web Programming". It teaches the basics of binary and is targeted towards high school students.

Unfortunately we created the app using a WebIDE which hid certain code in some files, so it would be impossible to download the files and run the project locally.
