# Binary 0101

Unfortunately, the project required Binary 0101 to be created using a WebIDE which hid certain code in some files, so it would be impossible to download the files and run the project locally. However, you can still try the app using [this link](https://cs1xd3.online/ShowModulePublish?modulePublishId=0a6330dc-6e05-447c-820f-293aca08929a&fullscreen=true)! There is also more information on [my website](https://owengretzinger.com/)
